# Updated-Portfolio

## Description

* In this assignment I tried to create a portfolio that is better than the last one showcasing new things that i have learned.

* For this specific work I had to create three html pages, 1 js file and 2 stylesheet.

* I tried to create a navbar that would start at the bottom and become sticky once it got to the top, however my code did not work.

* my main background image would not work if I would have it smaller, my first idea was for it to cover only half of the page but since I could not get it moving unless it took up the whole view, I had to work around it.

* I tried making the images placed in the portfolio to move when hovering over then but it would either mess with the layout or not work.

* I tried making some improvements over the last profile that i created, I will put more effort and start looking for new ideas for the next update.



## Improvements-needed

* I would like to animate it a lot more.

* In the future I would like to add a better background and maybe more interaction with the user.

* I feel that there is not enough flashiness to my website and I would like to improve that..

## Reocurring-Errors

* not everything was adjusting the way that i wanted the containers to move.

* some effects were harder to implement than they looked, i had to remove a lot of code.

* There are a lot of ideas outthere of how to create profiles but most things do not prove examples of how to put them into accion.

* I created way too many divs and I would put the classes or ids in the wrong places

* I tried to use js, but there was not much use for it right now since most of it is just css.

## Resources

* I used screenshot images from past work in the portfolio.

* Google was very useful, When ever I needed a reminder of how to possition something or get ideas on what to do.

* The inspect option on my websites was a great way to move stuff in the websites without having to write and errase my code every time i wanted to do something.

## Appreciations

* Thank you to whoever took the time to go through my pages and codes. 

## Updates of 2-9-2020
