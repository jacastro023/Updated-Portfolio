            <div class="info col-9">Currently I an learning to code throught the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp, am I am
                really
                enjoying what
                I am learning and hope to Start a new carreer as a Web Developer after the bootcamp. Learning all of
                these
                new languages and techniques is extremely entertaining and it is an amazing feeling when you do
                something
                right.
                <br>
                I am currently unemployed and focusing on this bootcamp to better myself and set a good example for my 5
                year old son. Ever since before he was born I had been working in a plastic factory doing manual labor
                in a dead end job and I want to do something more with my life, something that my son can be proud of. I
                want to be able to support my family without them worrying if I will get hurt at work or if I will still
                have a job the next day.</div>

        <div class="row col-12">
            <div class="info col-9">In my previous job I was worked for over five years for the same company, HPI, a
                plastic factory. My job title before I quit was of Color Tech. My main duties was to take care of the
                whole factory and all of the machines that involved color and quality control of the colors required. I
                worked with heavy machinery and was forklift certified. I work well with others, I trained five other
                color techs for other shifts besides mine. I can manage my time as well as manage others to get the work
                done.
                <br>
                My future goals are to work as a Web Developer and create things that I can be proud to show others.
                Unlike the gif shown, I take my job seriously and work safe.</div>
